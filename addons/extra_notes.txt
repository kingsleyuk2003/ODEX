The invoicing policy and the control purchase bills for "All services" should be "Ordered quantities" and "On received quantities",
 so that you can be able to create invoice, since there is no shipment picking to receive.
 Otherwise you will not be able to create invoice if you choose "based on delivered quantities"

Note that Consumables are what the business uses up. So no need for accounting stock valuation.
The expenses can be recorded from the purchase invoice. But it can be received into the warehouse
with the a recorded inventory value.
